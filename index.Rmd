- Approximately 4.7 million deaths.
- Comprised 49% of all-cause mortality. 
- 16,939 DALYs per 1,00,000. 
- 50–70% of patients treatment in private facilities.
- States with a higher disease burden like Kerala, utilize private health facilities more than the public health facilities. 
- Hospitalization for NCDs pushed 47% of the households to catastrophic expenditure. 
]

.pull-right-2[

- Private health facilities pushed more households to CHE (66.3%) as compared to public health facilities (17.1%).

#  Ayurveda for the Management of Non Communicable Diseases

.blockquote[
"One who carefully observes the rules regarding diet and behavioural practices, consumes healthy and wholesome food, observes beneficial practices, carries himself thoughtfully in daily activities, does not succumb to passion and greed, who cherishes a selfless noble generous nature, has equal respect for every living being in all conditions, speaks and relies on the truth, maintains a forgiving attitude and reposes faith in knowledgeable, experienced and elderly persons is successful in maintaining healthy living and a healthy body and in leading a disease-free, peaceful, healthy and happy life"

.content-box-purple[
The efficiencies of such practices in providing long lasting effect on such NCDs need to be  compared, documented and published in standard journals, rather  than obscure journals that will facilitate in involving traditional  practices in the management of NCDs.
